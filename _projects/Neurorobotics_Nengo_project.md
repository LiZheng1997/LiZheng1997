Based on the [repository](https://github.com/abr/neurorobotics-2020), I reproduced their work. You can find their paper through this [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurorobotics/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2020.568359/full).


Some screenshots are attached below, these pictures show the results of a rover robot approching a random generated target in the simulator.
