This is a project for picking out s single package when there are parallel packages. The Normal situation is that two packages are closing to each other, but sometimes a difficult situations is that one package will be too close to the other one or two packages.

POSP means Pick Out Single Package, this project aims at solving the problem of parallel packages transporting on a conveyor belt. Like the video shows below:
