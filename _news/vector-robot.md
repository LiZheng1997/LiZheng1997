In the winter of 2019, I bought my first Vector Robot on Amazon when I was in UK.
Then, After the period of Covid-19, the company which saled Vector Robots closed down.
Now, the owner of Vector Robots services changes to the [Digital Dream Labs](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs)

Then, I found a open-sourced [repository](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod) which can provide fully-featured server software for the Anki Vector Robot.

Some relevant pictures are attached bellow:
