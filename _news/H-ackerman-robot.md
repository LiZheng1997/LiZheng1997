The H-Ackerman robot is mounted with a Jetson Xavier and a stereo camera. It is based on the Ackerman chassis theory, not a differential base. The following picture is this robot:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Hackerman-robot.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

This robot is mainly designed for reproducing a Teach & Reapt project when I was doing the short term internship with Dr. Li Sun in the University of Sheffield. You can find more details in the projects page, named T & R Visual Navigation.
