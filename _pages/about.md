I graduated from the University of Sheffield, earning a Masterâ€™s degree in Advanced Computer Science with distinction. During my postgraduate studies, I focused on courses such as Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence, Software Development for Mobile Devices, Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems, Spiking Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning, and The Intelligent Web. Under the guidance of my supervisor, Eleni Vasilaki, I studied the fundamental theories of spiking neural networks and reinforcement learning. I selected a MiRo biomimetic robot from the Sheffield Robotics Lab as my platform and developed an end-to-end vision system based on biomimetic theories. The detailed code has been open-sourced on my [Github](https://github.com/LiZheng1997/MiRo-CV-System).

Throughout this process, I discovered a passion for research work and hope to dedicate more time to studies in the fields of spiking neural network and robotics. Currently, my research interests include Spiking Neural Networks, Event Cameras, Bio-inspired Adaptive Robotics, End-to-End Autonomous Systems, Autonomous Driving, Long-term Learning, Imitation Learning, and more.
